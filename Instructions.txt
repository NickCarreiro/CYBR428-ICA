You must first create the webserver and its contents:
  This is very simple, and entirely automated.

To create this environment, you must first pull from this git repository:

  In a terminal shell, run the following commands:

    mkdir sandbox #this is to hold the files being pulled, best for organization
    cd ./sandbox

    git init
    git pull https://github.com/NickCarreiro/CYBR428-ICA.git

    chmod +x *.sh #this allows all bash scripts to be executed

    sudo ./create.sh #installs necessary dependencies for the exercise, this should take at most 2-3 minutes.

Once these commands have been run, your environment is ready for you. Now we will simulate the basic stages of an attack chain, recon and enumeration.

  In a terminal shell, run the following commands:

    cd ./sandbox #if not already in your sandbox

    sudo ./run.sh #wait for this command to complete, this will initialize the simulated web-server

    nmap -sV -T4 0.0.0.0

  What port is the webserver running on? We will refer to it as <port>. We will now run enumeration using gobuster against this webserver, this will allow us to discover pages which may not be intended for public view.

    sudo gobuster dir -w ./ica_wordlist.txt -u http://0.0.0.0:<port>

  This should have returned many hits, visit each of these pages and find at least 2 flags, the format for these flags will be:
    FLAG{flagDetailsHere}
